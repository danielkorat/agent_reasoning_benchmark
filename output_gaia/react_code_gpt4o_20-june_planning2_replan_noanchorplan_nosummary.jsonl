You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: \nThis will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question.\nAsk him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving.\nProvide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\nAnd don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['time', 'zipfile', 'Bio', 'collections', 'os', 'xml', 'numpy', 'itertools', 'statistics', 're', 'json', 'pandas', 'sklearn', 'scipy', 'yahoo_finance', 'unicodedata', 'math', 'pubchempy', 'queue', 'sympy', 'random', 'requests', 'bs4', 'stat']\n9.

The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: \nThis will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question.\nAsk him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving.\nProvide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\nAnd don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['itertools', 'statistics', 'bs4', 'time', 'sklearn', 'math', 'zipfile', 're', 'json', 'numpy', 'requests', 'pandas', 'unicodedata', 'xml', 'yahoo_finance', 'queue', 'os', 'pubchempy', 'stat', 'Bio', 'sympy', 'collections', 'scipy', 'random']\n9.
